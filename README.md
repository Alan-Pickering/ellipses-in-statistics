# ellipses-in-statistics
This repository will contain code which explores the ellipses underlying Galton's 1885/6 discovery of the 
bivariate normal distribution and their relevance to regression.<br>
The code relates to the contents of this blog:-<br>
https://samplingdistribution.blogspot.com/2023/02/galtons-most-important-statistical.html <br>
There is initially only one programme script (myellipse2.m).<br>
This is initially in Matlab only although an Octave version will follow soon I hope.
