# ellipses-in-statistics
This repository will contain code which explores the ellipses underlying Galton's 1885/6 discovery of the 
bivariate normal distribution and their relevance to regression.
There is initially only one programme script (myellipse2.m).
This is initially in Matlab only although an Octave version will follow soon I hope.
